[TECH-20250710] Logging System Implementation
- Context: Infrastructure (Meta-Logging)
- Options Considered:
  1. Simple file-based logging
  2. Database-backed logging
  3. Structured file system with categorization
- Decision: Implemented structured file system with categorization
- Rationale: 
  - Better organization of different log types
  - Markdown format for easy reading and processing
  - File-based system for simplicity and version control
  - Categories support different analysis needs

Implementation Details:
- Four log types: DEV, TECH, LEARN, QUAL
- Timestamp-based file naming
- JSON-compatible metrics storage
- Weekly report generation
- Async operations for better performance

Quality Gates:
- TypeScript for type safety
- Jest tests for all functionality
- Error handling for file operations
- Clear interface definitions

Next Steps:
1. Implement log rotation
2. Add search functionality
3. Create visualization tools
4. Add export capabilities

[TECH-20250710] Test Suite Implementation
- Context: Quality Assurance (Testing)
- Decision: Implemented comprehensive test suite
- Details: 
  - Mock file system operations
  - Test all log types
  - Verify report generation
  - Check format consistency

Coverage Goals:
- Functions: 100%
- Statements: >90%
- Branches: >85%
- Lines: >90%

[TECH-20250710] Type System Design
- Context: Development (Type Safety)
- Decision: Implemented strict type system
- Details:
  - Interface-based design
  - No any types
  - Required fields for critical data
  - Optional fields for flexibility

Type Hierarchy:
- MetaLog: Base log structure
- Specific log interfaces
- Utility types for metrics
- Context types for metadata
